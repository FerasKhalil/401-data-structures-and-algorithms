# Challenge Summary
- write three functions for linked lists the first is appending to the end of the cell
    - second is to insert a new value before a specific value in the list
    - third is to insert a new value after a specific value in the list

## Approach & Efficiency
time is O(n)
space is O(1)

## Solution
it runs just fine i included the code in the white board and also in these files
all functions are tested and everything runs perfectly

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
time is o(n)
space is o(1)

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
it runs just fine i included the code in the white board and also in these files
3 tests runs and passes successfully
