## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- Time = o(n)
- space = o(1)

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
- The code runs and gives the right result. A test is written and the right result is returned.


# Code challenge 17 

# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- You need to write a function given 1 parameter that will return a list of all values in the tree, in the order they were encountered.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- Big O of time complexity is o(h) which means it depends on the height of the tree
- Big O of space complexity is o(n)
## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
- My code is still not working properly, it needs some changes.


# challenge 18

# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
You need to write a function that replaces all nodes with 'FizzBuzz' if the answer was 0 when doing mode on 3 and 5
and replace nodes with 'Fizz' if nodes were only equals 0 if mode by 3
and replaces nodes with 'Buzz' if nodes were equal 0 when doing mode by 5
